#  Employee Addendum Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to receive an *addendum* (bonus or contract adjustment) based on their profile, past records, and job-related factors.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Dataset
- Data includes features such as:
  - Employee tenure,Performance score, Age,Gender,Department
  - Employment type, salary, working hours
  - Previous addendums, performance rating
- *(Dataset not uploaded for privacy.)*

---

##  Modeling Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building Logistic Regression and Random Forest
5. Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
6. Model Selection

---

##  Results
- Best accuracy: `96%` with Random Forest
- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve included in results

---

##  Future Work
- Test deep learning models
- Build a Streamlit app for deployment
